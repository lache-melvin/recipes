# Mum's Tomato and Brown Rice Soup

Serves 4–6 as a main or 6–8 as a starter\
Time: 2¼ hours + 12–24 hours soaking

* extra virgin olive oil
* ½ large onion, diced
* ½ small bunch (40g) of flat-leaf parsley, leaves and stalks separated, both finely chopped
* 1 large rosemary sprig (oregano or bay leaves also work well) 
* ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
* Big pinch freshly ground black pepper
* 1.25 kg ripe heirloom tomatoes/canned tomatoes
* 2 large garlic cloves, crushed
* 1 teaspoon unrefined sugar(e.g. rapadura)
* 110g (½ cup) medium-grain brown/arborio rice, soaked for 12–24 hours in water with a splash of vinegar, then drained 
* 1.5 litres vegetable stock or water (or a combination)
* juice of 1 large lemon
* unrefined salt

1. Add a generous splash of oil to a large, heavy-based saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, parsley stalks, rosemary, paprika and pepper and sauté for about 5 minutes until the onion has softened.
2. Break the tomatoes into the pan, tearing them apart roughly. Add the garlic and sugar and increase the heat to high. Cook for 5 minutes, trying not to stir, until the tomatoes stick to the base of the pan a little. Reduce to 
a simmer and add the rice, stock or water and 2 tablespoons of oil. Cover and simmer for about 2 hours. 
3. After 2 hours, the rice should be super soft but still hold its shape. The soup should be sticky and thick, look oily and delicious, and some tomato chunks should remain. Turn off the heat and stir in the lemon juice, then season to taste.
