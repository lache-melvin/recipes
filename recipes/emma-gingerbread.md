# Emma's Gingerbread

[Recipe here](https://albrown.co.nz/cook/sweet-stuff/best-gingerbread-in-the-world)

### Emma also says:
add crystallised ginger once itâ€™s in the tins

I also add 1/3 cup of black strap molasses as part of the golden syrup amount reducing the golden syrup by a third

I do not add extra spices other than ginger and I add more ginger than he says
