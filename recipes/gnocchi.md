# Gnocchi

SERVES: 3-4

## Ingredients

#### GNOCCHI (need to find a vegan GF version
* 700–800g Agria (or other floury) potatoes, scrubbed (leave skin on) 
* 1 egg
* ¾ teaspoon salt
* 150g ‘00’ Italian flour or plain flour

#### QUICK ITALIAN TOMATO BASIL SAUCE
* ¼ cup olive oil
* 4 cloves garlic, sliced 
* 1 – 1 ½ 400g cans crushed or chopped tomatoes 
* a handful of basil leaves (if you have it)


* Plus cheese optional!


## Method

1. Preheat oven to 200°C. Place whole potatoes on an oven tray and bake for about 1 hour (depending on the size of potatoes) until very tender — test with a skewer or tip of a sharp knife; it should poke right through with no resistance. 
2. Cut potatoes in half and peel off the skins or scoop out the flesh while still warm. Push warm potato flesh through a potato ricer or a sieve (with the help of the back of a large spoon) into a large bowl. This ensures light gnocchi; whatever you do, do not mash the potato as it’ll make your gnocchi dense and lumpy. 
3. Add egg and salt and mix in well with a fork. Sift in flour and use your hands to bring together as a soft dough. Add a little more flour if needed — it should feel dry to the touch, but not crumbly, and feel lovely and soft. Knead just a few times, then cut into six pieces. 
4. On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece out into a log about 30cm long, then cut into bite-sized 2cm pieces. The gnocchi are ready to cook just like this or, if you wish, gently push the tip of your thumb into the centre of each piece whilst gently rolling it, to make a little indent (this makes the perfect little hollow for sauce to pool in). Place in a large dish or on a tray (with a lip) dusted with flour, and shake pieces around gently to coat. Set aside until ready to cook. 
5. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a rapid boil and preheat oven to grill. While the water is coming to the boil, make the sauce. Heat olive oil in a large heatproof fry pan on medium heat. Sizzle garlic for 1 minute (do not let it brown), then stir in crushed tomatoes. Simmer gently for 15 minutes or so until thickened, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir through basil if using. 
6. Drop about half of the gnocchi (one by one) into the boiling salted water and cook until they bob to the surface. As soon as they float to the surface, scoop them out with a slotted spoon and transfer straight into the pan of tomato sauce. Repeat with remaining gnocchi. 
7. Once all the gnocchi are in the sauce, gently toss to coat in sauce and top with cheese(es). Place under the oven grill for about 5 minutes or until sauce is bubbling and cheese is melted. Serve immediately. 


## Tips & Substitutions
- You can use the same amount of orange kumara or pumpkin in place of the potatoes. If the dough feels a little sticky, just add a bit more flour. 
- If you don’t have fresh basil, you could use a pinch of dried herbs (e.g. Oregano or mixed dried herbs) in the sauce. 
- The exact amount of flour you need will depend on the brand of flour and the potatoes you’re using, so you may need to add a bit more flour. Add extra flour sparingly – you want enough to hold the dough together, but not so much that the gnocchi become dense and heavy. 
- Make the dough with still-warm potatoes. This encourages the egg to bind the dough. 
- Handle your gnocchi gently. Overworking the dough develops the gluten (which can make gnocchi more tough). Mix your dough and shape it with a light touch. 
- If this is your first time, it can be a good idea to cook a couple of gnocchi before you shape and cook all of them. That way you can add more flour to the dough if your testers fall apart.
-  Do not over-cook the gnocchi – as soon as they bob/float to the surface, remove them with a slotted spoon. 
-  You can freeze your gnocchi – freeze solid in a single layer on a tray lined with baking paper, before placing in a sealed bag. When ready to cook, simply pop them straight into rapidly boiling water to cook.
